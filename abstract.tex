\begin{abstract}

In this work we developed some tools to work with IFU spectra from the CALIFA
survey. The spectra from the spaxels are preprocessed, an then analyzed using
the software \starlight. One of the main tools discussed here, PyCASSO, written
in Python, organizes the output from \starlight into datacubes of stellar
population synthesis: It also allows for interactive exploratory programming,
giving easy access to the data.

Using these tools, we developed a method for recovering and analysing the
stellar populations of the different morphological components of galaxies using
IFS data. Using the software Imfit, wrapped in Python, we perform the
decomposition of a sample of 43 candidate S0 galaxies from the CALIFA Survey
into a Sérsic bulge and an exponential disk. The decomposition is made
wavelength-wise, so that at the end we get the bulge and disk spectra for each
pixel. A good PSF measurement is critical to this process, so we perform a
characterization of the PSF using the calibration stars from the survey. The
morphological parameters ($r_e$, $n$, P.A. and $\epsilon$ for bulge, $h$, P.A.
and $\epsilon$ for disk) in most cases depends linearly on the wavelength, in
average, but their behavior, in each $\lambda$ are not yet fully unerstood.
Using the decomposed spectra from the 9 best decompositions from the sample we
apply a stellar population synthesis using \starlight, in order to recover the
stellar populations of bulge and disk. Only two of those galaxies produced good
\starlight fits, K0592 and K0858. In both cases we recover an older and lower
metallic bulge and an younger and more metallic disk (in comparison to the whole
galaxy). The stellar synthesis produces more robust results using the integrated
spectra. The spatially resolved spectra from bulge and disk seem to have
artifacts that get interpreted as dust, among other things, thus leading to
wrong results.
